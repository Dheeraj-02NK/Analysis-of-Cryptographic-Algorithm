# Analysis-of-Cryptographic-Algorithm
A Comparative Analysis of Cryptographic Algorithms

# Abstract

With billions of internet users worldwide and the continuous growth of digital communication, data security has become a critical issue. Confidential data shared over the internet is vulnerable to cyber-attacks, and thus, there is an urgent need to secure the information transmitted over the network. Cryptographic algorithms play a crucial role in protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access. In this research paper, we perform a comparative analysis of different cryptographic algorithms and evaluate their time complexity. We investigate the efficiency and security of each algorithm to determine which one is comparatively better for data protection. security. We conducted experiments to calculate the time complexity of these algorithms based on the length of the message or string that is encrypted. Our study evaluated the efficiency and security of each algorithm to determine which one is better suited for data protection. Our findings show that the evaluated algorithms have different levels of time complexity, with some algorithms being faster than others for messages of different lengths. The results of our study provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of different cryptographic algorithms and can be useful for researchers, cybersecurity professionals, and organizations concerned with data security.

# Conclusion

AES and RSA are secure encryption algorithms used to protect digital data. While AES is faster and more efficient than RSA, RSA provides better security features such as key management and digital signatures. The choice of encryption algorithm depends on the specific security of the application and the resources available for management and computing power. However, it is worth noting that both algorithms are very secure and nearly unbreakable when used correctly, making them a good choice for secure communication.
